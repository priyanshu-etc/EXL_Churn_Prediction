# EXL Churn Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts **credit card customer churn** for EXL using historical customer data.  
It involves **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning** using a **Random Forest Classifier**.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

## ðŸš€ Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning** â†’ Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formatting.  
2. **EDA** â†’ Understand data distribution and correlations through visualizations.  
3. **Feature Engineering** â†’ Create new features like `balance_salary_ratio`, scaling numerical features.  
4. **Model Training** â†’ Train a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn.  
5. **Evaluation** â†’ Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.  

## ðŸ“Š Key Visualizations
- Age, balance, and salary distribution before & after scaling  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Feature importance ranking  
- Confusion matrix for model performance  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

## ðŸ“¥ Installation & Usage
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd EXL_Churn_Prediction

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run scripts
python Scripts/data_cleaning.py
python Scripts/feature_engineering.py
python Scripts/random_forest.py

If you want, I can also **auto-generate the `requirements.txt`** by scanning all your `.py` scripts so itâ€™s ready for GitHub. That will make your project plug-and-play for anyone cloning it.  

Do you want me to do that next?
